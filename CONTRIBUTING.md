## ü§ù How Can I Contribute?

### Adding New Badges

Found a free Credly badge that's not on our list? Great! Here's how to add it:

#### Prerequisites

1. **Verify it's free**: The badge must be 100% free with no payment required
2. **Check it's not already listed**: Search the README to avoid duplicates
3. **Confirm it's from Credly**: Must be hosted on credly.com

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/credly-badge.git
   cd credly-badge
   ```

2. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-badge-[organization-name]
   ```

3. **Add the badge information**
   
   Find the appropriate organization section in README.md and add your badge following this format:

   ```markdown
   <tr>
     <td align="center" width="20%" style="padding:10px">
       <a href="[CREDLY_BADGE_LINK]">
         <img src="[BADGE_IMAGE_URL]" width="100">
       </a><br/>
       <a href="[CREDLY_BADGE_LINK]">[Badge Name] - [Organization]</a>
     </td>
     <td width="80%" style="padding:10px">
       <strong>Description:</strong> [Brief description]<br/>
       <strong>Skills:</strong> [Skill 1], [Skill 2], [Skill 3]<br/>
       <strong>Criteria:</strong> [How to earn the badge]<br/>
       <strong>Time to Earn:</strong> [Hours/Days/Weeks]<br/>
       <strong>Level:</strong> [Foundational/Intermediate/Advanced]
     </td>
   </tr>
   ```

4. **Update badge count** (if applicable)
   
   If adding a new organization, update the organization count at the top of README.md

5. **Test your changes**
   
   Open README.md in a markdown viewer to ensure formatting is correct

6. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add [Badge Name] from [Organization]"
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin add-badge-[organization-name]
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**
   
   Go to the original repository and click "New Pull Request"

#### Pull Request Template
