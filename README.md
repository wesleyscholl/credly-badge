### 🏅 What's Credly? 
Think of it as your digital trophy case! Credly is the go-to platform for showcasing your skills, training achievements, exam completions, and professional accomplishments. It's like LinkedIn's cool cousin who loves to celebrate your wins! Credly uses tamper-proof open badge technology with cryptographic security, making your credentials instantly verifiable and fraud-resistant. Each badge contains rich metadata including skills earned, time investment, and verification status (some include blockchain backing). When you share badges anywhere, recipients can click to verify authenticity in real-time. You can also manage and track all your badges from your **Badge Wallet**, keeping all of your accomplishments organized in one place.

### 🎉 100% Free, No Strings Attached!
The best part? Every single badge listed here is 100% FREE - no hidden fees, no payment required, no catch! While there are thousands of training resources out there, not all offer that satisfying proof of completion. This curated collection focuses on those that do, so you can build an impressive portfolio while learning valuable skills.

### 🎯 More Than Badges—Proof of Skill
Credly also offers a **Skills Wallet**—a dynamic way to display your verified skills. You can add skills, reorder them, and even attach evidence from your earned badges. Skills backed by Credly are marked as “Verified”, meaning they’re supported by actual credentials. It's not just about collecting badges—it’s about proving what you know. 🔍💡

### 💰 What About Paid Badges?
While this collection focuses on free badges, many paid Credly certifications are excellent investments. For example, the [Certified Argo Project Associate Certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-argo-project-associate-capa/) from the Linux Foundation is extremely challenging and valuable. However, quality varies - some paid badges are overpriced or subpar. Research thoroughly and stick to reputable organizations. **🌟 Pro tip**: If an organization offers high-quality free courses, chances are their paid training will the the same quality or higher!
